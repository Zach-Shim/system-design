A **network partition** occurs when a distributed system's nodes (servers or computers) are unable to communicate with each other due to a failure in the network. This means the system gets "split" into two or more isolated parts that can't exchange data, even though each part may still function independently.

### Causes of Network Partitions

1. **Physical Issues**: Damaged network cables, hardware failures, power outages, etc.
2. **Software Failures**: Bugs or misconfigurations in networking software or routing protocols.
3. **Congestion**: Overloaded networks dropping packets or delaying communication.
4. **Geographical Separation**: Servers located far apart, with intermittent or unstable communication links.

### Real-World Example

Imagine a global online store with servers in New York and London. If the transatlantic communication cable gets damaged:

- The New York servers can still serve customers in the U.S.
- The London servers can serve customers in Europe.
- However, they canâ€™t sync inventory data between them.

If a customer in New York buys the last item in stock, the London servers won't know, leading to **inconsistent data**.

### Why It Matters

In distributed systems, network partitions are common due to the complexity of maintaining flawless communication over the internet or within large corporate networks. Systems must be designed to handle partitions gracefully, balancing **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance** as described by the CAP theorem.
