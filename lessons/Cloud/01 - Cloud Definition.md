## **The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing**

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a definition for cloud computing that is accepted industry wide.

**Definition:**
Cloud computing is a **model** for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, and on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

This cloud model is composed of 

- Five essential characteristics, 
- Three service models, 
- Four deployment models.

## **What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is like using electricity or water at home. Instead of owning the resources (like a generator for electricity), you "rent" computing power, storage, or software from a company over the internet, and you only pay for what you use.

Cloud computing is like renting a computer that’s always online. You can use it whenever you want, share it with others, and don’t have to worry about fixing it. You pay only for what you use, and everything is managed for you.
### **Key Terms and Concepts**

We will dive deeper into these terms in the following lessons.

1. **Model**:
    - A **model** is a structured way of doing something. Here, it refers to a framework or system that explains how cloud computing works.

1. **Ubiquitous**:
    - Means "available everywhere." Cloud computing can be accessed from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection.

2. **Convenient**:
    - It’s easy to use. You don’t need to install complicated software or buy expensive hardware; everything is ready for you.

3. **On-Demand Network Access**:
    - You can use the resources whenever you need them without waiting for someone to set them up. It’s like flipping a switch to turn on the light.

4. **Shared Pool of Computing Resources**:
    - A large collection of things like servers, storage, and applications that many people or companies share. Think of it like a library where multiple people borrow books (resources) as needed.

5. **Resources**:
    - Examples include:
        - **Networks**: Systems that allow devices to communicate (like the internet).
        - **Servers**: Powerful computers that handle requests and store data.
        - **Storage**: Space to save your files, like a virtual hard drive.
        - **Applications**: Software programs, like email or word processors.
        - **Services**: Tools or systems that help you do specific tasks, like translating text or analyzing data.

6. **Rapidly Provisioned and Released**:
    - **Provisioned**: Set up and made ready to use.
    - **Released**: Stopped or removed when you’re done.
    - In the cloud, this happens quickly. You can add or remove resources in seconds or minutes.

7. **Minimal Management Effort**:
    - You don’t have to do much to keep it running. The cloud provider takes care of things like maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting.

8. **Service Provider Interaction**:
    - The cloud company (like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google) provides the service. You don’t need to contact them every time you want to use or change something—it’s mostly automated.
