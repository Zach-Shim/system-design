## Architecture Overview
Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system should be **organized** and **designed** to satisfy the **functional** and **non-functional** requirements of a system.

**Box Diagramming**
**Block diagrams** present a **high-level** picture of the system structure

Each **box** in the **diagram** represents a **component**.
**Boxes within boxes** show that the **component** has been **decomposed** to **subcomponents**.

**Arrows** mean that **data** and or **control signals** are passed from **component** **to** **component**.
