The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the process that development teams use to design and build software. 

This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into different steps and tasks required to build a software application. 

We outline a common software development lifecycle below:

1. Requirements: 
   Find out what the customer wants
   
2. Architecture & Design:
   Plan how to build the system to meet requirements

3. Implementation: 
   Execute your plan (and unit-test your code)

4. Testing/QA:
   Check if you conformed to your plan (verification) and if you met customer expectations (validation)

5. Maintenance: 
   Ongoing changes to the system
